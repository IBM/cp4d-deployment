# Cloud Pak for Data 4.5 on AWS

## Deployment Topology:

Deploying this template builds the following Cloud Pak for Data cluster in single zone or multi zone.

![Alt text](images/aws_arch.png)

The deployment sets up the following as shown in the diagram.
 - A highly available architecture that spans one or three Availability Zones.
 - A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
 - In the public subnets:
   - Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
 - In the private subnets:
   - OCP master instances up to three Availability Zones
   - OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) compute nodes.
   - Elastic Block Storage disks that are mounted on the compute nodes for container persistent data.
 - A Classic Load Balancer spanning the public subnets for accessing Cloud Pak for Data from a web browser. Internet traffic to this load balancer is only permitted from ContainerAccessCIDR.
 - A Network Load Balancer spanning the public subnets for accessing the OCP master instances. Internet traffic to this load balancer is only permitted from RemoteAccessCIDR.
 - A Network Load Balancer spanning the private subnets for routing internal OpenShift application programming interface (API) traffic to the OCP master instances.
 - Amazon Route 53 as your public Domain Name System (DNS) for resolving domain names of the IBM Cloud Pak for Data management console and applications deployed on the cluster.

### Prerequisites
* Following modules are required to be installed as prerequisites:
  * Terraform 
  * wget
  * htpasswd
  * python3
  * AWS CLI
  * jq
  * Openshift CLI
  * podman
 
* Alternatively run the below scripts to install all prerequisites:
  * For RHEL:
  ```bash
  ./linux-prereq-install.sh
  ```

  * For Mac:
  ```bash
  ./mac-prereq-install.sh
  ```

### Steps to Deploy:
* AWS `Access key ID` and `Secret access key` will be required for the deployment. Also `AdministratorAccess` policy is required for the IAM user which will be used for deploying the cluster.
* Before deploying the infrastructure make sure you have `python3` installed in your local machine.
* Create a Route 53 domain.
* S3 is the default repository storage for the OpenShift image registry.
* [Download](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) a pull secret. Create a Red Hat account if you do not have one.
* [Sign up](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42212) for a Cloud Pak for Data Trial Key if you don't have the API key.
* If you choose Portworx as your storage class, see [Portworx documentation](PORTWORX.md) for generating `portworx spec url`. Also see [Portworx troubleshooting documentation](PORTWORX-TROUBLESHOOTING.md) to fix commonly encountered issues when installing Cloud Pak for Data on Portworx storage on AWS.
* Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```
* Change the current directory to `aws`:
```
cd cp4d-deployment/selfmanaged-openshift/aws/
```
* Read the license [here](https://www14.software.ibm.com/cgi-bin/weblap/lap.pl?li_formnum=L-DNAA-BZTPEW) and accept it by setting variable `accept_cpd_license` to `accept`.
* If you want to hide sensitive data such as access_key_id or secret_access_key, create a `aws.tfvars` file and write all the sensitive variables.
* You can use the `wkc-1az-ocs-new-vpc.tfvars` file in this folder with preset values for a cluster with WKC enabled on OCS storage on a new VPC cluster. Note that the `<required>` parameters need to be set.
* You can also edit `variables.tf` and provide values for all the configuration variables. See the [Variables documentation](VARIABLES.md) for more details.

* Deploy scripts by executing the one of following commands

If using the variables.tf file

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply | tee terraform.log
```

OR 

if you are using the `cpd-1az-new-vpc.tfvars` file

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file=cpd-1az-new-vpc.tfvars | tee terraform.log
```

#### cp4d installation logs:
After openshift cluster installation is finished and cloud pak for data installation has started, you can check the installation logs for cp4d service as described here: [cp4d service installation logs](INSTALLATION-LOG.md)

### Destroying the cluster:
* When cluster created successfully, execute following commands to delete the cluster:
  ```bash
  terraform destroy
  ```
* If cluster creation fails, execute following commands to delete the created resources:
  ```bash
  cd installer-files && ./openshift-install destroy cluster
  terraform destroy -var-file="<Path To terraform.tfvars file>"
  ```
### Note:
* For a Private Cluster deployment, you need to deploy from a machine that will be able to connect to the cluster network. This means either from the same network or from a peered network.

### Exception:
* After deploying `Watson Discovery` on cluster, execute following command to set the memory limit of RabbitMQ pod (wd-rabbitmq-discovery-0) to 2GB:
  ```
  oc patch wd wd --type=merge --patch '{"spec": {"rabbitmq": {"resource": {"limits": {"memory": "2Gi"}}}}}'
  ```
  After you execute the oc patch command, the RabbitMQ pod (wd-rabbitmq-discovery-0) will be restarted automatically. You can check the completion of the restarting of the pod with "oc get po wd-rabbitmq-discovery-0" where you can see its readiness new age.


### Changelog
* Updating the installation to CPD 4.5 and adding support for EFS and EBS storage.
