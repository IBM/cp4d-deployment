# Cloud Pak for Data 4.5 on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)

Cloud Pak for Data is an end to end platform that helps organizations in their journey to AI. It enables data engineers, data stewards, data scientists, and business analysts to collaborate using an integrated multiple-cloud platform.
Cloud Pak for Data uses IBMâ€™s deep analytics portfolio to help organizations meet data and analytics challenges. The required building blocks (collect, organize, analyze, infuse) for information architecture are available using Cloud Pak for Data on Azure.

Cloud Pak for Data uses cloud native services and features including VNets, VPCs, Availability Zones, security groups, Managed Disks, and Load Balancers to build a highly available, reliable, and scalable cloud platform.

This deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying IBM Cloud Pak for Data on a [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift).

This reference deployment provides ARM templates to deploy Azure ARO Cluster with cloupak for data installation.

 - A Azure ARO cluster.
 - A highly available storage infrastructure with OpenShift Container Storage.
 - Scalable OpenShift compute nodes running Cloud Pak for Data services. See [Services](#cloud-pak-for-data-services) for the services that are enabled in this deployment.
 
 Note: ARO at this time provisions OpenShift Container Platform v4.10.x. This may be changed when new versions are released. See support lifecycle [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/openshift/support-lifecycle)

## Cost and licenses
Cloud Pak for Data offers a try and buy experience.
The automated template deploys the Cloud Pak for Data environment by using Azure Resource Manager templates.
The deployment template includes configuration parameters that you can customize. Some of these settings, such as instance count, will affect the cost of the deployment. For cost estimates, see [Azure ARO pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/pricing/details/openshift/). Prices are subject to change.

## Deployment on Azure

### Prerequisites
- [Azure Client (az cli)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Azure Service Principal, with Contributor and User Access Administrator.

The Service Principal can be created by running the azure CLI commands from any host where azure CLI is installed.

  * Create Azure Service Principal with `Contributor` and `User Access Administrator` roles.
    * **Option 1:** using the script provided in the `scripts` folder:
      ```bash
      az login
      scripts/createServicePrincipal.sh -r "Contributor,User Access Administrator"
      ```
    * **Option 2:** running the commands manually:
      * Create Service Principal, using your Azure Subscription ID, and save the returned json:
        ```bash
        az login
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<subscription_id>"
        ```
      * Get `Object ID`, using the AppId from the Service Principal just created:
        ```bash
        az ad sp list --filter "appId eq '<app_id>'"
        ```
      * Assign `User Access Administrator` roles, using the `Object Id`.
        ```bash
        az role assignment create --role "User Access Administrator" --assignee-object-id "<object_id>"
        ```
    * Save the `ClientID` and `ClientSecret` from either option.

2. [Download](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret) a pull secret. Create a Red Hat account if you do not have one.

3. [Sign up](https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-42212) for Cloud Pak for Data Trial Key if you don't have the entitlement api key

4. Read and agree to the [license terms](https://ibm.biz/BdqyB2)

### Deploy

* There are two methods to deploy this script. 

## Using your Azure Account Portal

[![Deploy To Azure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/1-CONTRIBUTION-GUIDE/images/deploytoazure.svg?sanitize=true)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FIBM%2Fcp4d-deployment%2Fmaster%2Fmanaged-openshift%2Fazure%2Farm%2Faro%2Fazuredeploy.json)


* Click on the above button and input the variables in the template in the azure portal 

## Using Command Line

* Enter variables in `azuredeploy.parameters.json`. See the [PARAMETERS.md](./PARAMETERS.md) for detailed descriptions.
```bash
az login
./az-group-deploy.sh -a [folder_name] -l <region> -g <resource_group> -e /path/to/parameters_file
```
Example:
```bash
./az-group-deploy.sh -a aro -l westus2 -g myocp-rg -e aro/azuredeploy.parameters.json
```

## Access CPD

* The webconsole URL can be found in the `ResourceGroup`>`Deployments`>`CPD`>`Outputs`.

* The cluster credentials are located on the bastion node at this path

```
~/.openshift/templates/kubecredentials
```

You can also list the credentials using this command

```
az aro list-credentials --name <cluster-name> --resource-group <resource group name>
```

* The deployment logs are located on the bastion node at this path

```
/var/lib/waagent/custom-script/download
```

## Delete the Cluster

```
az aro delete --resource-group <resource_group> --name <cluster_name> --yes
az group delete -n <resource_group> --yes
```

## Troubleshooting

### Insufficient CPU/Memory (Scale Up the cluster)
**Switch to `openshift-machine-api` namespace:**
```
$oc project openshift-machine-api
```

**Fetch machineset:**
```
$oc get machineset
```

**Scale up particular machineset:**
```
$oc scale machineset <machine_set_from_above_cmd> --replicas=<number_of_replicas_you_want_to_create>
```
